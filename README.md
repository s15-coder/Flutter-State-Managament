# State Management

A flutter project created along the [Fernando Herrera course](https://www.udemy.com/course/flutter-avanzado-fernando-herrera/) where explains the differences between the state management alternatives in a very simple way.

State management types explained:
1. [GetX](https://pub.dev/packages/get) - [GetX branch]( https://github.com/s15-coder/Flutter-State-Managament/tree/branch/GetX)
2. [BLoC](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_bloc) - [BLoC branch]( https://github.com/s15-coder/Flutter-State-Managament/tree/branch/bloc)
3. [Cubit](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_bloc) - [Cubit branch]( https://github.com/s15-coder/Flutter-State-Managament/tree/branch/cubit)
4. [Provider](https://pub.dev/packages/provider) - [Provider branch]( https://github.com/s15-coder/Flutter-State-Managament/tree/branch/provider)
5. [Singleton](https://flutterbyexample.com/lesson/singletons) - [Singleton branch]( https://github.com/s15-coder/Flutter-State-Managament/tree/branch/singleton)
